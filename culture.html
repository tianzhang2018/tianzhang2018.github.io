<p id="text3"> The rise of modern Shanghai in just one hundred years is a miracle in the history of Chinese development. A city is alive when it is full of culture and hai pai (mainly referring to Shanghai) culture is at the root of Shanghai's energy and charm.<br>Before 1843, Shanghai culture mainly came from the ancient kingdoms of Wu and Yue, from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces. After 1843, when western civilization came to China through Shanghai for the first time, Shanghai developed rapidly into the national commercial and economic centre. Thus hai pai culture, the combination of Chinese and Western cultures, gradually formed.
<br>The term hai pai (literally 'Shanghai style') was coined by a group of Beijing writers in 1920 to criticize some Shanghai scholars and styles of writing for their admiration of money and western cultures. Hai pai is rebellious while its opposite jing pai, or 'Beijing style', is traditional. They represent two kinds of different Chinese cultures. The famous author Cao Juren wrote in the article Jing Pai and Hai Pai in the 1920s that, "jing pai is like a fair lady, while hai pai is like a modern babe."<br>The unconventional 'Yuanyang Hudie Pai,' Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Genre in literature.<br>A group of scholars in the Shanghai art and literary circles spontaneously organized 'yuanyang hudie pai', the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly genre of popular romance in the early 1900s. This style of writer, such as Zhang Henshui and Qin Shou'ou, entertained the audience with amusing and light literature.
